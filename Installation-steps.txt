A. Building & Installing Falcon
===============================

1. Building Falcon
------------------

* git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-falcon.git falcon
* cd falcon
* export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m" && mvn clean install

[optionally -Dhadoop.version=<<hadoop.version>> can be appended to build for a specific version of hadoop]
[Falcon has currently not been tested with secure Hadoop / Hadoop 2.0]

Once the build successfully completes, artifacts can be packaged for deployment.
By default the falcon is built for embedded mode.

* mvn clean assembly:assembly -DskipTests

Tar can be found in {project dir}/target/falcon-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz

Tar is structured as follows

|- bin
   |- falcon
   |- falcon-start
   |- falcon-stop
   |- falcon-config.sh
   |- service-start.sh
   |- service-stop.sh
|- conf
   |- startup.properties
   |- runtime.properties
   |- client.properties
   |- log4j.xml
   |- falcon-env.sh
|- docs
|- client
   |- lib (client support libs)
|- server
   |- webapp
      |- falcon.war
|- hadooplibs
|- README
|- NOTICE.txt
