Falcon Entity Alerting service do the following things :

   1.Monitor instances of feed and process and send notifications to all the listeners attached to it.
   1.In case of feed it notifies when a *slaHigh* miss happens.
   1.In case of process it notifies when a sla miss for *shouldEndIn* happens.

Entity SLA Alert service depends upon [[EntitySLAMonitoring][Falcon Entity SLA Monitoring]] to know which process and feed instances are to be monitored.

*How to attach listeners:*

We can write custom listeners to do some action whenever a process or feed instance misses its sla.
To attach listeners please add below property in startup.properties :

<verbatim>

*.entityAlert.listeners=org.apache.customPath.customListener

</verbatim>

Currently Falcon natively supports [[BacklogMetricEmitterService][Back Log Emitter Service]] as a listener to EntitySLAAlert service

*Dependencies :*

To enable Enity SLA Alerting service we need to enable [[EntitySLAMonitoring][Falcon Entity SLA Monitoring]]

*Properties :*

 Following properties are needed in startup.properties:

<verbatim>

*.application.services=org.apache.falcon.service.EntitySLAAlertService
