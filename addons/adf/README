ADF Provider
=======================


Overview
---------

This integration allows Microsoft Azure Data Factory pipelines to invoke Falcon activities
(i.e. replication, hive and pig proessing work), so the user can build a hybrid Hadoop data pipelines
leveraging on-premises Hadoop clusters and cloud based Cortana Analytics services
like HDInsight Hadoop clusters and Azure Machine Learning.


Usage
---------

Falcon reads Azure Service Bus credentials from conf/startup.properties when it starts.
So, the credential needs to be added before starting Falcon,
and Falcon needs to be restarted if there is any change in the credential.

Example:

######### ADF Configurations start #########

# A String object that represents the namespace
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.namespace=hwtransport

# Request and status queues on the namespace
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.requestqueuename=adfrequest
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.statusqueuename=adfstatus

# A String object that contains the SAS key name
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.sasKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey

# A String object that contains the SAS key
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.sasKey=4kt2x6yEoWZZSFZofyXEoxly0knHL7FPMqLD14ov1jo=

# A String object containing the base URI that is added to your Service Bus namespace to form the URI to connect
# to the Service Bus service. To access the default public Azure service, pass ".servicebus.windows.net"
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.serviceBusRootUri=.servicebus.windows.net

# Service bus polling frequency (in seconds)
*.microsoft.windowsazure.services.servicebus.polling.frequency=60
