Hive Mirroring Extension

Overview
Falcon provides feature to replicate Hive metadata and data events from source cluster to destination cluster.
This is supported for both secure and unsecure cluster through Falcon extensions. Falcon uses event­based replication capability provided by hive to implement the Hive mirroring feature.
Falcon will act as admin/user­facing tool which will have fine control on what and how to replicate as defined by its users, while leaving the delta, data and metadata management to hive itself.
Hive mirroring extension piggy backs on Distcp tool for replication.

Use Case
* Replicate data/metadata of Hive DB & table from source to target cluster

Limitations
* Currently Hive doesn't support create database, roles, views, offline tables, direct HDFS writes without registering with metadata and Database/Table name mapping replication events.
Hence Hive mirroring extension cannot be used to replicate above mentioned events between warehouses.
