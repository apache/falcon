HDFS Directory Replication Extension

Overview
This extesion implements replicating arbitrary directories on HDFS from one
Hadoop cluster to another Hadoop cluster.
This piggy backs on replication solution in Falcon which uses the DistCp tool.

Use Case
* Copy directories between HDFS clusters with out dated partitions
* Archive directories from HDFS to Cloud. Ex: S3, Azure WASB

Limitations
As the data volume and number of files grow, this can get inefficient.
