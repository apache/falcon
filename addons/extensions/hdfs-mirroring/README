HDFS Mirroring Extension

Overview
Falcon supports HDFS mirroring extension to replicate data from source cluster to destination cluster.
This extension implements replicating arbitrary directories on HDFS and piggy backs on replication solution in Falcon which uses the DistCp tool.
It also allows users to replicate data from on-premise to cloud, either Azure WASB or S3.


Use Case
* Copy directories between HDFS clusters with out dated partitions
* Archive directories from HDFS to Cloud. Ex: S3, Azure WASB

Limitations
* As the data volume and number of files grow, this can get inefficient.
