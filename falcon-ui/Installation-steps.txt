A. Building & Installing Falcon-UI
===============================

0. Prerequisites
------------------

You would need the following installed:

* JDK 1.7+
* Maven 3.x+

1. Building Falcon
------------------

* cd falcon-ui
* mvn clean install


2. Deploying Falcon to sandbox
-------------------

- grunt deploy
This will build and send to the sandbox /usr/hdp/2.2.0.0-913/falcon/webapp/falcon/public/ location the falcon webapp
Then navigate to localhost:15000


3. To test in the express server
-------------------
- grunt dev
This will launch an express server with the falcon-ui to localhost:3000
(You can test there all UI related behaviours and express will mock all falcon REST calls)
